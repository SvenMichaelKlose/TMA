Coding style guidelines

	Source

	Please remember that writing assembly code is a lot easier than
	understanding one. Don't make other one's eyes burn with continuous
	streams of code filling several pages, leave blank lines after single
        operation blocks with single comments, split large functions into
	smaller ones.

	Comments

	Please leave off comments that won't help much. Single instructions
	usually don't need one. Let identifiers do what they're supposed to
	do.
	It is good to comment registers or stack contents that were used long
	ago, but there shouldn't be need for this.

	Segment access

	TMA is going to become a hybrid code program that will process in
	any processor mode. Writes to the code segment will cause a
	segmentation fault in protected mode. See GLOBAL\GLOBAL.INC for
        the special segment macros. Use them, even if they're dummies. No one
        wants to browse the whole source if you didn't, you're code will
	crash after a garbage collection or a mode switch.
