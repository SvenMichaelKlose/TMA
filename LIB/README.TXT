Yet another README...

 In this branch you'll find various snippets of code that are ready to
 be compiled by TMA but there's a lot of old code that needed speed.
 (The target was a 386sx-20...) and things like GFX\SCROLLX.INC don't
 work properly. I also missed to translate lots of the comments but I
 already have little spare time.
 I also didn't write all of this on my own. Some sound functions were
 copied and rewritten for my pleasure...now it's yours.
